Master student graduated from UC Berkeley EECS 25🐻. Recently focusing on multimodal generative model.

My research interests lie in Multimodal, Computer Vision and Graphics, particularly on and their applications on Video Gen🌊. My lifelong goal is to join the real world to the virtual, ushering the “metaverse” into reality🥽.
