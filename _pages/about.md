I am a forth-year bachelor's student at Northeastern University, majoring in Software Engineering. My lifelong goal is to join the real world to the virtual, ushering the “metaverse” into reality. 

My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. I currently have a focus on inverse rendering problems, especially on the part of the light estimation and editable scene reconstruction.
