I am a third-year bachelor's student at Northeastern University, majoring in Software Engineering. Besides a strong interest in coding, I'm also keen on mathematics.My research interests lie in computer vision and its' intersection with graphics, like neural implicit representation, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering.I currently have a focus on single RGB view 3D reconstruction, especially on the part of the latent representation from 2D input to 3D.
