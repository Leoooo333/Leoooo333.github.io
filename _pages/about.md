I am a third-year bachelor's student at Northeastern University, majoring in Software Engineering. Besides a strong interest in coding, I'm also keen on mathematics. My research interests lie in 3D computer vision and computer graphics, like neural rendering and 3D reconstruction.

I currently have a focus on inverse rendering problems, especially on the part of the light estimation and editable scene reconstruction.
