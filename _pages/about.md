I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley EECS🐻. My lifelong goal is to join the real world to the virtual, ushering the “metaverse” into reality🥽. 

My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics, particularly on Generative Models and their applications in Video Generation🌊.

🌟Seeking a full-time job beginning from June 2025🌟.
