## Description
***
In this project, I research individually, developing a recommendation algorithm for the short video. My work is below.

## My works
***
- Predict usersâ€™ behavior based on multi-modal features, like user interaction, and visual embeddings.
- Feature Engineering. Extract the high-order visual features like face features to enhance our model.
- Ensemble learning.
