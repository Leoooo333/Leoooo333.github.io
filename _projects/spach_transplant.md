***
SPACH is a new NN that developed by Microsoft, which is used to compare CNN, ViT, MLP.

In this project, I:
- Reproduce a new image classification model named SPACH, and transplant it from GPU to Huawei NPU.
- Construct and run training and inference scripts for both GPU and NPU on remote Linux servers.
- Achieve the gold quality medal from Huawei Corporation to honor my work on SPACHâ€™s transplant.

Finally, my implementation of the NPU version contributed to the official repository. Check it below.
